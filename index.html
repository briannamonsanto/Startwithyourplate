				With the rise of the climate change agenda, it can be hard for some people to know what actions they can take to help positively change the planet. Luckily, one of the steps one can take starts right with their diet. Adopting a vegan lifestyle has been shown to have a myriad of benefits for the environment; check out the ways eating animals impacts the environment and how making the switch to a vegan lifestyle can positively affect the environment.

<h2>How An Animal-Based Diet Impacts The Environment</h2>

    		<br> The Agricultural industry is the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases (EPA). This is because of how industrial farming relies on large groups of livestock. Animals such as cows rely on grass and hay as a large part of their diet and the gas and manure they expel releases large amounts of methane into the earth. Once methane is released, it can stay in the atmosphere for up to twelve years as it contributes to the warming effect. The industrial agriculture industry is one of the largest contributors of methane emissions. </p>

    			As the population increases, the demand for more food production increases. This means farmers need more cattle to produce more meat. More cattle means the need for more land; thus, habitat destruction occurs to keep up with the demand. Raising cows for beef is one of the largest causes of tropical deforestation in the world.

    					<img src="water.png" width="300" height="300" alt="Water symbol" class="center">

    					Raising cattle for meat consumption utilizes a lot of our resources on earth. For instance, raising cattle alone requires a gargantuan amount of water. To produce one pound of beef, one needs 1,799 gallons of water (Dubay 2018). As the population increases, the amount of beef needed to be produced increases. This will require a large amount of our natural resources to be used up.

	<h2>How A Plant-Based Diet Impacts The Environment</h2>

    		<img src="footprint.png" alt="Footprint symbol" class="center">

    		When one adopts a vegan lifestyle, they lower their ecological footprint. Those with a vegan lifestyle actually have one of the lowest ecological footprints at a whopping 1.5 tons of CO2 emissions. This is a large difference compared to those who eat meat. Their ecological footprint is more than twice as large (3.3 tons of CO2 emission/ person)!

    		<div class="icon-explanation">

    			<img src="biodiversity.png" alt="Biodiversity symbol" class="center">

    			When one adopts a vegan lifestyle, they help to increase biodiversity. The habitat 	
destruction associated with raising cattle is deleterious for animals in the environment because they risk losing their native homes. When one eats a vegan diet, they do not contribute to the need for agriculture expansion and instead, rely on a diet that does not require as much land use.

    			<div class="icon-explanation">

    				<img src="soil.png" alt="Soil symbol" class="center">

    				Raising livestock can damage the health of our earthâ€™s soil. As we increase the amount of cattle needed to fulfill the demand for meat, the risk of overgrazing increases. Overgrazing harms the health of soil by reducing the nutrients and creating a thinner layer of soil. This can result in barren land. Maintaining a vegan lifestyle can help to increase soil nutrients (Ott 2018).
