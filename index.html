    		The Agricultural industry is the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases (EPA). This is because of how industrial farming relies on large groups of livestock. Animals such as cows rely on grass and hay as a large part of their diet and the gas and manure they expel releases large amounts of methane into the earth. Once methane is released, it can stay in the atmosphere for up to twelve years as it contributes to the warming effect. The industrial agriculture industry is one of the largest contributors of methane emissions.

    			As the population increases, the demand for more food production increases. This means farmers need more cattle to produce more meat. More cattle means the need for more land; thus, habitat destruction occurs to keep up with the demand. Raising cows for beef is one of the largest causes of tropical deforestation in the world.
